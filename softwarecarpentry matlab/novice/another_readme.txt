- Everything in italics are planned, but not actually written yet.
- I tried to base the first chapter loosely on the python lesson.
- If you want to go and change something, or make suggestions, please go ahead and do so.

Things I'd appreciate help with in particular:
Chapter01:
- More prose to put commenting into context, because that's not mentioned in the python lesson.
- Naming conventions - in the scripts / commenting section.

Chapter02:
- How much "Testing" should there be? I can write a simple testing function (I think), to introduce the concept. Not a bad idea to start early on that I think. 
- Make sense of the challenges. Do we want to work with text (like python), or just with numbers? If text, we need to introduce concatenation. Not sure if that would help at all.
