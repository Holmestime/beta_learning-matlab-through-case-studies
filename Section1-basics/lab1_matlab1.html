It's another learning tool.</p><p>Why MATLAB, not a different language? * Common in the field * Interpreted - see results immediately * Data visualization</p><h2>Introduction to Matlab - Interface<a name="2"></a></h2><p>Let's familiarize ourselves with the MATLAB interface. Work by typing these commands into the interpreter: the window with the line starting with "&gt;&gt;".

</pre><pre class="codeoutput"> SIZE   Size of array.  
    D = SIZE(X), for M-by-N matrix X, returns the two-element row vector
    D = [M,N] containing the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
    For N-D arrays, SIZE(X) returns a 1-by-N vector of dimension lengths.
    Trailing singleton dimensions are ignored.
 
    [M,N] = SIZE(X) for matrix X, returns the number of rows and columns in
    X as separate output variables. 
    
    [M1,M2,M3,...,MN] = SIZE(X) for N&gt;1 returns the sizes of the first N 
    dimensions of the array X.  If the number of output arguments N does
    not equal NDIMS(X), then for:
 
    N &gt; NDIMS(X), SIZE returns ones in the "extra" variables, i.e., outputs
                  NDIMS(X)+1 through N.
    N &lt; NDIMS(X), MN contains the product of the sizes of dimensions N
                  through NDIMS(X).
 
    M = SIZE(X,DIM) returns the length of the dimension specified
    by the scalar DIM.  For example, SIZE(X,1) returns the number
    of rows. If DIM &gt; NDIMS(X), M will be 1.
 
    When SIZE is applied to a Java array, the number of rows
    returned is the length of the Java array and the number of columns
    is always 1.  When SIZE is applied to a Java array of arrays, the
    result describes only the top level array in the array of arrays.
 
    Example:
    If
       X = rand(2,3,4);
    then
       d = size(X)              returns  d = [2 3 4]
       [m1,m2,m3,m4] = size(X)  returns  m1 = 2, m2 = 3, m3 = 4, m4 = 1
       [m,n] = size(X)          returns  m = 2, n = 12
       m2 = size(X,2)           returns  m2 = 3

##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% Lab 1 overview:
% * What's MATLAB? Why MATLAB?
% * Interface
% * Variables
% * Matrices and vectors: creation and access
% * Built-in functions
% * Operating on matrices and vectors
% * Plotting
% * Saving your work as a script

%% What's MATLAB? Why MATLAB?
%
% MATLAB is a programming language and an environment.
%
% Why code in general? You can write your own analyses.
%
% Why use code in this course? So you can try out the math. Visualize it.
% Make it concrete. It's another learning tool.
%
% Why MATLAB, not a different language?
% * Common in the field
% * Interpreted - see results immediately
% * Data visualization
%

%% Introduction to Matlab - Interface
% Let's familiarize ourselves with the MATLAB interface.
% Work by typing these commands into the interpreter: the window with the
% line starting with ">>". Type your commands after ">>" and hit enter.

%% MATLAB as Calculator

% Copy these lines to the prompt (">>" in the other window) and run them
% one at a time:
3+4
5-9
4*6
5*(3+4)
26/5
5^2
pi

% You can use the "up" arrow at the prompt (">>") to go back to previous
% commands you typed.
%
% If you start typing and then use the up arrow before you're done, it will
% find you all past commands that start with the letters you just typed.

%% Variables
% We can assign values to variables with =
a = 7;
a
% Now, the value of our variable "a" won't change...
a + 1;
a + 1;
a
% ... unless we re-assign a value to it
a = 41;
a

% Can we assign a variable to another variable? What happens?
b = a;
b

c = a + 1;
c

% If b = a, then what happens when we change a?
a = 10;
b
c

% The way this works is that MATLAB has a lookup table. When you type
% something, like "a", it looks in the lookup table for the associated
% value. When you type "a = 1", it puts "1" in the lookup table as the
% value for "a".

% We don't have to be boring and use single letters as variable names. In
% general, it's a VERY good idea to use descriptive names for your
% variables.
darthVader = 7;
han_solo = 4*4;
R2D2 = (han_solo + darthVader)/2;

% Note that we use underscores instead of spaces in variable names.
% Also, we can't use a hyphen, because "han-solo" would be read as "han" minus
% "solo"!

% Another neat feature of the prompt: If you type part of a variable name and
% then hit "tab", you can see possible completions. Try typing "darth" and
% then hitting tab.

%% Workspace
% MATLAB uses a table to look up the variables. You can view this table in
% the "workspace" in your matlab editor. This is useful to you for keeping
% track of the variables you've assigned. You can view the contents with
% "who" ("whos" is similar and gives you more information)

who

% You can use a semicolon to suppress output.
% The command you run still causes changes in the workspace,
% so your variable is different next time you look at it

a = 5;
a

% You can also cause output to be shown with the "display" command:
display('a');

%% Matrix and vector creation: basics
% How to enter the matrix
a = [1 2 3] % This is a row
a = [1, 2, 3] % This is also a row, the commas are optional
a = [1; 2; 3] % This is a column: the semicolons make a new row
a = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6] % This is two columns, three rows

% How do I enter a whole range of numbers?
a = [1:10] % 1 through 10, counting by 1, as a row
a = [1:2:10] % Start at 1, count up by twos, don't go past 10
a = [10:-1:4] % Start at 10, go down by 1, don't go past 4

a = [1:3; 4:6; 7:9] % Make three rows of three each

% Transpose operator flips rows and columns
a = [1:10]'

%% EXERCISE
% Try creating different arrangements of the numbers 1 through 6.
% Can you create a row vector? A column vector? The row 1 2 3 above the row
% 4 5 6? The column 1 3 5 beside the column 2 4 6?

%% Vector access
% Let's create a vector.
% A note on names: we don't have to call our variables only "a" all the time.
% Using descriptive names will help you later. For now, we'll call our
% variable "vec" so we remember that it's a vector.
vec = [101:112];

% Access elements in a vector using parentheses
vec(2) % This gives us the second element of the vector
vec(4)

% Access multiple elements at once
% Instead of just one number in the parentheses, we can put a range of numbers.
vec(3:6); % This gives us elements 3, 4, 5, and 6.

% "end" is a special keyword for accessing the last element.
vec(end) 
vec(1:end)

% The colon operator alone puts everything into one column. We'll see more
% of it later to understand why it's useful.
vec(:)

%% Matrix access
% Let's create a matrix to play with, and call it "mat".
mat = [1:3; 4:6; 7:9];

% We can use *two* subscripts to access elements of our matrix by
% specifying the row and the column. (Row first, then column).
mat(2,1)
mat(3,3)

% As before, each subscript can be a single number or a range of numbers
mat(2, 1:3)
mat(1:3, 2)
mat(2:end, 1);

% As before, the colon operator selects "everything": all rows and/or all columns
mat(3,:)
mat(:,:)

%% EXERCISE
% Below is a matrix called "b".
% Write four expressions: one each to select just all the 0's, all the
% 1's, all the 2's, or all the 3's.
b = [2 2 2; 3 1 1; 3 1 1; 0 1 1];

%% Errors in matrix creation and access
% Sometimes there will be an error! Thats OK! That's totally normal!

% Examples of failed vector access:
test = [1 2 3];

% test(4) % "Index exceeds matrix dimensions" because we tried to take the
%   fourth element of a 1x3 vector, and 4 exceeds 3.

% test(0) % "Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or
%   logicals." We get this error because 0 is not a positive integer. Unlike
%   in other programming languages, there is no "zeroth" element. The first
%   element is indexed with 1.

% test(-1) % "Index exceeds matrix dimensions" again. I have no idea why
%   MATLAB doesn't first warn you that -1 isn't positive.

% Examples of failed matrix creation

% test = [1:3; 4:8]; % "Error using vertcat. Dimensions of matrices
%    being concatenated are not consistent." The problem is that we are
%    trying to put [1, 2, 3] in the top row and [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] in the
%    bottom row, but the rows are not the same size so there is no way
%    to "vertically concatenate" (vertcat) row 1 onto row 2.

%% Functions

% Functions are calculations that have names. For example in math notation
% "y = f(x)", f is the name of the function. x is the input. y is the output.

% Some functions perform mathematical operations:
abs(-2);
sin(pi/2);
round(2.7);
ceil(2.7);
floor(2.7);

% Some functions compute other properties of their inputs:
size(vec)
size(mat)
size(4) % notice while we're here that scalars are stored in matlab as 1x1 matrices

%% Getting help
% MATLAB contains extensive documentation, which you can access using the
% "help" command to view it in the command window, or the "doc" command to
% pull up a pretty window.
help size
doc size

which vec
which abs

%% An important aside about notation
% Watch out, there are two totally identical-looking parenthesis notations
% And they're totally different!
vec(3) % 1) accessing a vector/matrix element
abs(3) % 2) calling a function

% MATLAB will let you override built-in functions. Avoid this!
abs = [10, 11, 12];
abs(3)

which abs % Abs is now a variable??
% Yep,'abs' is in the list of variables! MATLAB looks there first
% In fact *every time* you type something, MATLAB has to look it up

% To remove a variable from the lookup table, use "clear":
clear abs
which abs

%% Matrix/vector creation: using functions
a = zeros(2, 3) % Create a matrix of all zeros, with 2 rows and 3 columns
a = ones(3) % Oops, this might seem like like "three ones", but it's actually 3x3!
a = ones(3,1) % We need to explicitly say "3 rows, 1 column"
a = ones(1,3) % or "1 row, 3 columns"

a = eye(3) % Identity matrix

a = rand(3, 3) % Uniform distribution
a = randn(3, 3) % Normal distribution
a = randi(10, 3, 3) % Integers up to 10

diag(a) % Extract the elements along the diagonal
triu(a) % Keep just the upper triangle, zero out the lower triangled(

%% Concatenating matrices
% Larger matrices can be built out of smaller matrices by concatenating
% them together. When concatenating matrices, their sizes have to line up.

c = [1:4]; % 1x4: 1 row and 4 columns
d = [11:14]; % another 1x4 matrix

% Horizontal concatenation:
% To stack beside each other, use a comma (like making a row vector!)
[c, d]

% Vertical concatenation:
% To stack on top of each other, use a semicolon (like making a column vector!)
[c; d]

% Concatenation requires sizes to match:
e = [101:104; 105:108]; % 2x4

% [d, e] % These won't stack beside each other because they have different numbers of rows
[d; e] % But one row stacks on top of two rows just fine!

%% Vector math
% Let's try some simple vector math: +, -, / (abs, floor, sin, sort)

% Set up variables to play with:
a = 4;
x = [1:5];
y = [11:15];
z = rand(1,7);

% Vector multiplied by a scalar
a*x
% Vector addition and subtraction (elementwise)
x + y
x - y

% Note that x + z fails, due to wrong sizes

%% Inner product
% inner_product = x * y
% why didn't the above work?
% we can look in the workspace window, or use size to figure out our variable sizes
inner_product = x * y'

% The inner product (dot product) sums the products of the elements.
% Both of the following are the same as the inner product:
x(1)*y(1) + x(2)*y(2) + x(3)*y(3) + x(4)*y(4) + x(5)*y(5)
sum(x.*y)

% inner product of perpendicular vectors is 0
[2 2] * [-5 5]'

%% Outer product
% The outer product (Cartesian product) expands two vectors into a matrix
% of their elementwise products
outer_product = x' * y

%% Element-wise operations
% .* operator ("Dot-times")
x.*y

% ./ operator
y./x


%% Summary statistics
% min, max, mean, std

% Vectors:
sum(x);
min(x);
max(x);
mean(x);
std(x);

% Matrices:
sum(mat) % Sum over rows. How do we sum over columns? Ask "help sum"
sum(mat,2) % Sum over the second dimension

% How to get the sum of ALL the values in the matrix?  There are several ways of
% coding this
sum(mat(1:end))
sum(mat(:));
sum(sum(mat));

% Average of our matrix
% average(mat) % hm, this function doesn't exist? Let's look at the help:
which average; % not found! interesting
lookfor average; % search the help docs for the word "average"
% oh, we wanted "mean", right.

mean(mat)
mean(mat, 1)
mean(mat, 2)

%% Plotting
 
% You can't just "plot a function" directly: first you have to define a
% discrete set of x values, then compute the corresponding y values, then
% plot the x points against the y points

% Let's define 10 points, and plot the "sin" function at those points:
x=[0:1:10];
y=sin(x); 
plot(x,y) 
plot(x,y,'o')
plot(x,y,'o-')
% (The above "plot" commands will overwrite each other in the figure window,
% so run each one separately if you want to see their separate output.)

% That image is too choppy. Let's try using more x values.
x = [0:(2*pi/100):(2*pi)]; % (Remind yourself how the colon notation works here)
y = sin(x);
plot(x,y,'o-');

% That was actually 101 points. What if we want 100 points?
x = [0:(2*pi/99):(2*pi)]; % way 1 - this is unreadable, don't do this
x = linspace(0,2*pi,100); % way 2 - this is readable!

%% Plotting multiple lines on the same axis
y = sin(x);
z = cos(x);
plot(x,y,x,z); 

% Plot without specifying your x values, it assumes 1:n
plot(y);

% Treat x like a parametric variable
plot(y,z); axis equal

%% More visualizations: histograms and scatterplots
plot(rand(1,100))
hist(rand(1,100))
hist(rand(1,1000))
hist(rand(1,1000000))
  
plot(rand(1,1000), rand(1,1000), 'o')
title('uniform')

plot(randn(1,100))
hist(randn(1,100))
hist(randn(1,1000))
hist(randn(1,10000))
hist(randn(1,100000),-4:0.1:4)
  
plot(randn(1,1000), randn(1,1000), 'o')
title('gaussian')


%% Scripts
% A script is a file that ends in ".m" which contains MATLAB code that's
% meant to be run all together.
% 
% Why write a script? 1) Save your work! 2) Run whole blocks of code at a time without typing it out at the prompt
%
% (TA will create a script now and show how it works in a workspace)
% The TA's script will demonstrate more plotting features:
% ylim, xlim
% axis( [0,3] , [0,3] )
% xlabel, ylabel
% title
% hold on
%
% Ways to use a script:
%
% 1. Use the green "RUN" button to run it all. This works just like typing
%   it all at the prompt
%
% 2. Use ctrl-enter or apple-enter to run just one subsection at a time
%   (subsections are separated by a double-percent "%%" at the start of the section)
