  	<h1>About</h1>
The goal of this curriculum development work is to update an existing
engineering problem solving course (ENG6) to introduce undergraduate
students to sustainable engineering. There are three goals:<br />
<ul>
<li> Sustainability focused lab exercises<br /></li>
<li> Hands-on experience</li>
<li> Project-based learning</li>
</ul>
<br />
Students who enrolled in the course will learn MATLAB through solving
sustainable/renewable engineering related problems. Students will also
gain hands-on experience working with hardware (Developed based on
Arduino UNO) to gather sunlight data.
The course emphasizes topics in solar cell technology, but other topics
such as green building design and electric vehicles are also briefly
covered.
<br />
<br />MATLAB Topics Covered: 1D, 2D vectors and manipulations,
mathematical and logical operations, loops, flow control, custom
function, structures, object-oriented programming, string regular
expression, Graphical User Interface design, and plotting.
<br />
<br />This course targets lower division undergraduate students
(however, some senior students also enroll) in all engineering and
scientific disciplines. The pre-requisite for the course is only
differential and integral calculus, no computer science (programming)
courses are required.
<br />
<br />
Important: Although students are introduced to various topics in sustainable engineering, the goal of the course is to teach <i>engineering problem solving</i> (and how to use MATLAB to model and solve engineering problems) and not sustainable engineering.

<h1>Engineering Problem Solving: Sustainable Engineering Theme</h1>
<h2>Introduction to Engineering 6 (From General Catalog)</h2>
Lecture: 3 hours; discussion: 1 hour. <br />
Prerequisite: Calculus -- differentiation and integration.<br />UC
Davis: Mathematics 16A or 21A, C- or above; Mathematics 16B or 21B (may
be taken concurrently).
Course description: Methodology for solving engineering problems.
Engineering computing and visualization based on MATLAB. Engineering
examples and applications.
<br />
<br />

<h2>Introduction to Solar Energy and Smart Building Design Theme</h2>We
plan to develop all of the course modules (lectures, notes) and
assignments (problem sets, programming exercises, labs, and projects)
for the new curriculum
around the theme of solar energy and smart building design. This theme
provides an opportunity to introduce the students to basic concepts of
renewable energy
generation, energy efficiency, embedded systems, and feedback while
simultaneously teaching basic programming skills. In the course of
completing their assignments,
students will learn to (1) program wireless sensors to measure
physically relevant signals, (2) access and process the sensor data to
develop models of physical systems,
(3) integrate the models into a design, and (4) simulate the design to
verify performance to specifications.<br />
